# fritzing-sundounder-part-for-picar

This is the part for the SunDounder 4wd HAT module for Fritzing.

At this moment, it is not finished - only an icon and a Breadboard view exists.
Will add more in the future.

If you happen to add a schematic or a PCB view to it before I do, send a pull request my way.
